This project entails creating my first smart contract using structs

I deployed a new contract named 'towna' that has a struct, called 'region' which contains a string of the name of a town and an int of the population of the town

I then created a dictionary called 'theAbout' which would contain details of the town

The 'addToAbout' function was then created to add values to the dictionary

Then I added the 'AddToAbout' transaction to call the addToAbout function in the contract

A script(getAbout) was then added to read the struct
